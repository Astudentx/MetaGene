# 🧬MetaGene

**MetaGene** is a comprehensive metagenomic data analysis tool that supports end-to-end processing, including species classification, functional gene identification, species tracing, and Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) analysis, starting from raw sequencing data.

## 🔧 Core Features

1. **Reads-based Species Classification**  
    Uses Kraken2 for efficient taxonomic annotation. The tool comes with a pre-built Pangenomes-based database and also supports custom database loading.

2. **Reads-based Functional Gene Identification and Tracing**  
    Based on a custom Python3 workflow, it supports the identification and tracing of the following major functional genes:
    - Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs)
    - Mobile Genetic Elements (MGEs)
    - Virulence Factors (VFs)
    - Metal Resistance Genes (MRGs)
    - Stress Genes (SGs)

3. **Contig-based Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) Analysis**  
    Integrates the [WAAFLE](https://github.com/biobakery/waafle) tool for identifying potential HGT events. It supports multiple databases (default Pangenomes database, as well as WAAFLE's `chocophlan2` database, etc.).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Preparation

- Prepare paired-end FASTQ files;
- Create a `<Paired_fastaq_list>` file using Tab delimiters, e.g.:
```bash
A1	/FilePath/A1.clean.1.fq.gz	/FilePath/A1.clean.2.fq.gz
A2	/FilePath/A2.clean.1.fq.gz	/FilePath/A2.clean.2.fq.gz
A3	/FilePath/A3.clean.1.fq.gz	/FilePath/A3.clean.2.fq.gz
```

- For HGT analysis, also prepare the corresponding assembled Contig files, using Tab delimiters, e.g.:
```bash
A1	/FilePath/A1.contig.ok.fa
A2	/FilePath/A2.contig.ok.fa
A3	/FilePath/A3.contig.ok.fa
```

### 2. Species Classification and Functional Gene Identification and Tracing

#### Gene Annotation Main Workflow (BP)

```bash
MetaGene BP --file <Paired_fastaq_list> --pwd <output_folder> --GeneType ARGs,MGEs
```

#### Gene Sequence Extraction and Tracing Table Generation (BP2)

```bash
MetaGene BP2 --file <Paired_fastaq_list> --pwd <output_folder> --GeneType ARGs
```

You can also perform analysis with external Kraken2 databases (Kraken2):
```bash
# By default, MetaGene BP will generate species analysis scripts in the shell folder. To specify a database, use Kraken's other databases.
MetaGene Kraken2 --file <Paired_fastaq_list> --db <database_name> --pwd <output_folder>
```

- Supported databases include: `BPTax_V1`, `BPTax_V2`, `krakenDB-202212`, `krakenDB-202406`

### 3. Horizontal Gene Transfer Analysis (HGT)

#### Contig Assembly (Megahit or SPAdes)

```bash
# You can choose your own assembled Contig files
# Additionally, Megahit and SPAdes assembly tools are provided for you to choose based on your needs
# Megahit: Recommended for less resource usage and faster speed
# SPAdes: Longer contigs, better accuracy, and more HGT events identified
MetaGene Megahit --file <Paired_fastaq_list> --pwd <output_folder> # Megahit
MetaGene SPAdes   --file <Paired_fastaq_list> --pwd <output_folder> # SPAdes
```

#### Horizontal Gene Transfer Analysis

```bash
MetaGene HGT --file <Contig_fasta_list> --db RefseqPan2 --pwd <output_folder>
```

- Optional databases include: `RefseqPan2`, `chocophlan2`, `UnigeneSet-waafledb.v1.fa`, `UnigeneSet-waafledb.v2.fa`

## 📂 Shell Script Explanation and Submission Recommendations

When using `MetaGene` for data analysis, a large number of `.sh` scripts are automatically generated for task submission. These scripts are located in the `shell/` folder, structured as follows (partial view):

```bash
# Tax Analysis----------------------
# Kraken2 species annotation
Tax.S01.Kraken2.A1.sh
# Merge to generate abundance table
Tax.S02.Kraken2.Merge.sh

# BP1 Analysis----------------------
# BP1 Reads sequence statistics
BP.S01.RawStat.A1.sh
# BP1 Reads functional gene annotation
BP.S02.ARGsAnno.A1.sh
BP.S02.MGEsAnno.A1.sh
BP.S02.MRGsAnno.A1.sh
BP.S02.SGsAnno.A1.sh
BP.S02.VFsAnno.A1.sh

# BP2 Analysis----------------------
# BP2 extract sequences for secondary annotation
BP.S03.temp.ARGs.0.sh
BP.S03.temp.ARGs.1.sh
BP.S03.temp.ARGs.2.sh
BP.S03.temp.MGEs.0.sh
# BP2 merge and generate abundance table
BP.S04.ARGs.Merge.sh
BP.S04.MGEs.Merge.sh
BP.S04.MRGs.Merge.sh
BP.S04.SGs.Merge.sh
BP.S04.VFs.Merge.sh

# HGT Analysis----------------------
# Reads assembly
Megahit.S01.Assambly.A1.sh
SPAdes.S01.Assambly.A1.sh
# WAAFLE HGT analysis
HGT.S01.chocophlan2.A1.sh

```

### 🧭 Shell Script Explanation

- `Tax.`: Taxonomic annotation (Kraken2 analysis)
- `BP.`: Functional gene annotation and tracing (including ARGs, MGEs, MRGs, SGs, VFs, etc.)
- `Megahit.` / `SPAdes.`: Assembly modules based on Megahit or SPAdes
- `HGT.`: Horizontal Gene Transfer analysis based on WAAFLE

### 🗂️ Submission Rules Recommendations

1. **Different Modules Can Be Submitted Independently**  
   E.g., `BP.` and `Tax.` modules can be submitted separately without waiting for each other to finish.

2. **Submit Tasks in Sequence Within the Same Module**  
   - For example, in the `BP.` module, submit tasks in the order of `BP.S01.` → `BP.S02.` → `BP.S03.` → `BP.S04.`
   - Different sample scripts within each stage (e.g., `BP.S01.RawStat.A1.sh` ~ `A6.sh`) can be submitted in parallel.

3. **Subtasks Are Automatically Named**  
   - Scripts are automatically named by sample ID (e.g., `A1` ~ `A6`) or task number, making it easier to track the analysis process.

4. **Do Not Skip Merge Steps**  
   - All `.Merge.sh` scripts (e.g., `BP.S04.ARGs.Merge.sh`) must be executed after all sample analyses in the corresponding stage are complete.
